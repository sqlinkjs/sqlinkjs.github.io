# Getting Started

Once **SQLink** is installed, you can start the application by running the following command in your terminal:

<TerminalView text="sqlink run -h [Host] -u [User] -p [Password] -P [Port] -D [Database] -o [Output Port]" />

---

## Command Parameters

All parameters are **mandatory** when starting SQLink:

- **`-h` (Host)**  
  The hostname or IP address of the MySQL server.  
  Example: `localhost` or `192.168.1.10`

- **`-u` (User)**  
  The MySQL user account that has access to the target database.  
  Example: `root`

- **`-p` (Password)**  
  The password for the MySQL user account.  
  Example: `mYsQlPa$$W0rd`

- **`-P` (Port)**  
  The port on which the MySQL server is running.  
  Default MySQL port is `3306`.

- **`-D` (Database)**  
  The name of the MySQL database to connect to.  
  Example: `users`

- **`-o` (Output Port)**  
  The HTTP server port where SQLink will listen for API requests.  
  Example: `3001`


### Example
<TerminalView text="sqlink run -h 192.168.1.10 -u root -p mYsQlPa$$W0rd -P 3306 -D users -o 3001" />

---

## How It Works

When the above command runs successfully:

1. SQLink connects to the specified **MySQL database**.  
2. An **HTTP server** starts on the given output port (`-o`).  
3. The server exposes REST endpoints corresponding to your database tables.  
4. Incoming HTTP requests are translated into SQL queries and executed on the database.  
5. Results are returned in a structured **JSON response**.
